After you have installed all this dependencies written in the README you
will be able to install weever.

create a postgresql database in which you will execute the sql file in 
db_scripts.

To build the required database structure you will need to run:

psql -U testuser -d weever < db_scripts/forum.sql

supposing you created a database named weever with an allowed user named 
testuser.

If you used different values or if the database is on a tcp connection you will 
need to modify files/weever.ini with your wanted parameters in the section 
Database.

Another thing you can configure from weever.ini is the post on which weever will 
be listening for new connections, by default 8080.

Once you have installed and configured the database you can run weever with:

twistd -oy weever.tac

(this will run weever as a daemon, use the -n option to run it on current shell)

The default database has no sections. And the root user is:
username: root
password: pass

after starting weever you will be able to add sections using the admin interface
under:

http://localhost:8080/admin/

Currently if you need to change the root password you will have to change that
from SQL.
