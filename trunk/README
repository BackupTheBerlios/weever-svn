Since Weever is currently under heavy development, you will need to get the 
very latest versions (from SVN) of both Twisted (required) and Nevow (required).
An additional dependency required by Twisted is ZopeInterface which can be downloaded from:
http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface/

I've tested it with psycopg2, but since I'm not using any special features provided with 
psycopg2 it should work with psycopg1 too.
