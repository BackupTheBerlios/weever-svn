This document explains the semantics of each url that we are going to implement. Currently it's different.

The new semantics are:

http://weever/ is the root url hot topics and sections
http://weever/viewtopic/4 topic 4
http://weever/viewsection/6 section 6
http://weever/viewreply/56 permalink for replies, view reply #56
http://weever/feedtopic/5 feed for section #5
http://weever/feedsection/5 feed for topic 6
http://weever/feed/ whole forum feed

All numbers are _absolute_ numbers, except the offset.
