Needed for 0.2:
- Last 15 topics RSS/Atom feed

- User profile page
- Full text indexing (page for getting results and submitting queries)
- Activate the form in the topics to select the number of posts per page
- Quote&Reply
- reST support
- permalinks
- More pervasive permission system, and more dynamic too.
- Optimize and clean here and there (imports, code reuse and such)
- Store the password hashed, not the cleartext one.
