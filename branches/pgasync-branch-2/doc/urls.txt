This document explains the semantics of each url that we are going to implement. Currently it's different.

The new semantics are:

http://weever/ is the root url hot topics and sections
http://weever/viewtopic/4 topic #4
http://weever/viewsection/6 section #6
http://weever/viewreply/56 permalink for replies, view reply #56
http://weever/feedtopic/5 feed for section #5
http://weever/feedsection/5 feed for topic #6
http://weever/feed/ whole forum feed

All numbers are _absolute_ numbers, except the offset.

deelan's alt. proposal  #1:
# ----------------------------------------------------

> http://weever/ is the root url hot topics and sections
ok

> http://weever/viewtopic/4 topic #4
> http://weever/viewsection/6 section #6
> http://weever/viewreply/56 permalink for replies, view reply #56
rewrite those as:

http://weever/topic/4 topic #4
http://weever/section/6 section #6
http://weever/reply/56 permalink for replies, view reply #56

"view" is the default (and most obvious) action, hence
you can supress it from the URL. 

> http://weever/feedtopic/5 feed for section #5
> http://weever/feedsection/5 feed for topic #6
> http://weever/feed/ whole forum feed

rename those in:

> http://weever/topicfeed/5 feed for section #5
> http://weever/sectionfeed/5 feed for topic #6
> http://weever/feed/ whole forum feed

deelan's alt. proposal  #2:
# ----------------------------------------------------

a bit more verbose but also more consistent:

> http://weever/ is the root url hot topics and sections
ok.

> http://weever/viewtopic/4 topic #4
> http://weever/viewsection/6 section #6
> http://weever/viewreply/56 permalink for replies, view reply #56
rewrite those as:

http://weever/topicview/4 topic #4
http://weever/sectionview/6 section #6
http://weever/replyview/56 permalink for replies, view reply #56

> http://weever/feedtopic/5 feed for section #5
> http://weever/feedsection/5 feed for topic #6
> http://weever/feed/ whole forum feed

like proposal #1

read this URLs as "the view for the topic", "the feed for the section",
and so on.
